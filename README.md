**Applied Data Science Portfolio - Christopher Beaver**

  I am an innovative research associate with more than a decade of experience in data collection, processing, analysis, and modeling within academia and for-profit companies.  I also have experience presenting complex statistical models in easily understood ways regardless of the experience of the audience.  Additionally, I have experience with purchasing, procurement, and budget monitoring while balancing administrative work with research.   Lastly, I routinely self-educate as needed to stay on track with the ever changing world of data science.
